Dear Blazo,

Thank you for your swift response and your willingness to assist us in this critical situation.

We have reviewed your price quotation and find the rates to be quite high, especially considering the large volume of the order. As a non-profit organization, we have limited funds available for this purchase. Is there any possibility of a discount or a more favorable pricing structure?

Additionally, we would like to ensure that the tents and cots meet our quality standards. Can you provide us with specifications and warranties for the products?

We look forward to your response and to working together to support the relief efforts in Location Zero.

Best regards,
