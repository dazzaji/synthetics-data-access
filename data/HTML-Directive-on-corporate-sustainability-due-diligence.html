First, </span><span>a </span><span>proper </span><span>information </span><span>collecti</span><span>o</span><span>n for reporting purposes under the</span><span> proposed</span><span> CSRD requires setting up processes, </span><span>which is closely related to</span><span> </span><span>identifying adverse impacts in accordance with the due diligence duty set up by this Directive. Second, the CSRD will cover the last step of the due diligence duty, namely the reporting stage</span><span>, for companies that are also covered by the CSRD</span><span>. </span><span>Third, </span><span>this Directive</span><span> will set obligations for companies to </span><span>have in place the plan ensuring that the business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming to </span><span>1.5</span><span> </span><span>°C</span><span> in line with the Paris Agreement</span><span> on which the CSRD requires to report</span><span>.</span><span> T</span><span>hus, t</span><span>his Directive will lead to companies’ reporting being more complete and effective.

New and emerging laws on due diligence are considerably different </span><span>in the Union </span><span>despite the intention of all the Member States to build on existing international standards (UN</span><span> </span><span>Guiding</span><span> Principles on Business and Human Right</span><span>s</span><span> OECD Responsible Business Conduct standard</span><span>s</span><span>) and thus lead to diverging requirements. </span><span>Certain </span><span>Member States </span><span>have</span><span> </span><span>adopt</span><span>ed, or</span><span> </span><span>are likely to</span><span> adopt</span><span>,</span><span> legislation that is limited to specific sustainability concerns in value chains.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span> Other Member States can be expected to decide not to legislate in this field. Significantly different requirements among Member States thus create fragmentation of the internal market. This fragmentation is likely to increase over time. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>This fragmentation</span><span> also</span><span> risks leading to an uneven playing field</span><span> for companies</span><span> within the internal market. First, companies and their directors – in particular of those which have cross-border value chains – are already subject to differing requirement</span><span>s</span><span> and will likely be subject to even more differing requirements depending on where their registered seat is located. This creates distortions of competition. Besides, </span><span>depending on how they structure their operations in the internal market</span><span>, some companies </span><span>may simultaneously </span><span>fall within the scope of two or more </span><span>different </span><span>national legal frameworks dealing with sustainable corporate governance.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref51" href="#footnote51">50</a>
               </span><span> This could lead to </span><span>duplication of requirements, difficulties in complying, lack of legal certainty for companies, and even mutually </span><span>incompatible parallel legal requirements. </span><span>Inversely, some companies may not fall within the scope of any </span><span>national framework for the mere reason that </span><span>they do not have links relevant under national law with the jurisdiction of a Member State that ha</span><span>s due diligence rules in place</span><span> and </span><span>thereby</span><span> </span><span>gaining</span><span> an advantage over their competitors</span><span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The proposed act is designed to prevent and remove such obstacles to free movement and distortions of competition by harmonising the requirements for companies to carry out due diligence in their own operation, subsidiaries and value chains and related directors’ duties. They will lead to a level playing field where companies of similar size and their directors are subject to the same requirements for integrating sustainable corporate governance and corporate due diligence measures in their internal management systems and thereby protecting the interests of the company’s stakeholders in a similar way. Harmonised conditions would be beneficial for cross-border establishment including company operations and also investments, since it would facilitate comparison of corporate sustainability requirements and make engagement easier and thus less costly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Article 50 TFEU is </span><span>lex specialis</span><span> for measures adopted in order to attain freedom of establishment. Among the proposed measures, those concerning companies’ corporate governance fall under this legal basis, in particular integrating due diligence into companies’ policies, measures on companies’ plan to ensure that the business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5 °C in line with the Paris Agreement, and related remuneration measures, as well as provisions on directors’ duty of care, and directors’ duties concerning setting up and overseeing due diligence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In order to address the described internal market barriers comprehensively, Article 50 TFEU is here combined with the general provision of Article 114 TFEU. Article 114 TFEU provides for the adoption of measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market. The Union legislature may have recourse to Article 114 TFEU in particular where disparities between national rules are such as to obstruct the fundamental freedoms or create distortions of competition and thus have a direct effect on the functioning of the internal market.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>As set out above, the differences between national rules on sustainable corporate governance and due diligence obligations have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market, and that impact is likely to increase in the future. Beyond the matters regulated in Article 50 TFEU, this act concerns other areas of the establishment and functioning of the internal market. Notably, in the absence of action by the Union legislator, the production and movement of goods and services would be skewed to the benefit of jurisdictions with no due diligence regimes or with less demanding regimes, or companies established in such jurisdictions, substantially impacting the flow of goods and services. Moreover, companies supplying goods or services, in particular SMEs, will be confronted with diverging rules and expectations from customers located in different Member States. For instance, whilst one Member State law may require the supplier to carry out third-party audits, another Member State may require the same supplier to participate in a recognised industry schemes and multi-stakeholder initiatives. One Member State may require the company to carry out due diligence in relation to established business relationships whilst the other Member State may cover the direct suppliers only. This would lead to a multiplication of different partially incompatible requirements distorting the free flow of goods and services in the Union.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>It is foreseeable that these distortions and impacts would become more serious with time as more and more Member States will adopt diverging national laws or may even lead to a race to the bottom in forthcoming due diligence legislations. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Distortions are also relevant for civil liability in case of harm caused in a company’s value chain. Some national legal frameworks on due diligence include an express civil liability regime linked to the failure to execute due diligence, </span><span>while </span><span>others expressly exclude a specific civil liability regime.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref52" href="#footnote52">51</a>
               </span><span> A number of companies have been brought before courts for causing or failing to prevent adverse impacts at the level of their subsidiaries or value chain</span><span>s</span><span>. Such cases are </span><span>decided</span><span> </span><span>based on differing rules today. In the absence of common rules, </span><span>divergent</span><span> </span><span>national liability regimes may lead to different </span><span>outcomes</span><span> </span><span>depending on whether there is ownership control (as regards subsidiaries) or factual control (</span><span>either </span><span>through direct contracts or where control could be exercised by the company through contractual cascading or other leverage in indirect </span><span>business </span><span>relationships). This fragmentation would </span><span>lead to distortions of competition </span><span>in the internal market as a company located in one Member State would be subject to damages claims due to harm caused in its value chain whilst a company with the same value chain would be exempt from this financial and reputational risk becau</span><span>se of diverging national rules.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The proposed civil liability regime would clarify which rules apply in case harm occurs in a company’s own operation, at the level of its subsidiaries and at the level of direct and indirect business relations in the value chain. In addition, the proposed provision on applicable law serves the purpose of ensuring application of the harmonised rules, including on civil liability, also in cases where otherwise the law applicable to such claim is not the law of a Member State. It will therefore be essential to ensure the necessary level-playing field.</span>

               <span>To the extent that this Directive also covers third-country companies, the criteria used for defining the scope of EU and non-EU companies covered are not the same, but ensure that third country companies are not more likely to fall within the scope. For them, a net turnover threshold is used (EUR 150 million for group 1 and EUR 40 million for group 2), but all of this turnover needs to be generated in the Union. EU companies, in turn, have to have a net turnover of EUR 150 million generated worldwide and have to fulfil an employee criterion as well (above 500 employees in group 1 and above 250 employees in group 2). Such difference in the criteria used is justified for the following reasons:</span>

The fact that EU companies will only be covered if they also reach the minimum limit on the number of employees is very unlikely to change the conditions of competition in the EU internal market: the two size criteria applicable to EU companies, even if cumulative, will result in still covering relatively smaller companies compared to non-EU companies due to the fact that, in their case, the entire worldwide net turnover of the company is to be taken into account.</span>

The harmonisation of the duties of directors is limited to EU companies only, thus third</span><span>-</span><span>country companies will have more restricted obligations.   </span>

Directors’ duties also include the clarification of how directors are expected to comply with the duty of care to act in the best interest of the company. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Effective enforcement of the due diligence duty is key to achieving the objectives of the initiative. This Directive will provide for a combination of sanctions and civil liability.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>As regards private enforcement through civil liability, a different approach is used regarding the company`s own operations and its subsidiaries on the one hand and regarding business relations on the other hand. In particular, civil liability concerns only established business relationships with which a company expects to have a lasting relationship, in view of its intensity or duration and which does not represent a negligible or merely ancillary part of the company`s value chain. The company should not be liable for failing to prevent or cease harm at the level of indirect business relationships if it used contractual cascading and assurance and put in place measures to verify compliance with it, unless it was unreasonable, in the circumstances of the case, to expect that the action actually taken, including as regards verifying compliance, would be adequate to prevent, mitigate, bring to an end or minimise the extent of the adverse impact. In addition, in the assessment of the existence and extent of liability, due account is to be taken of the company’s efforts, insofar as they relate directly to the damage in question, to comply with any remedial action required of them by a supervisory authority, any investments made and any targeted support provided as well as any collaboration with other entities to address adverse impacts in its value chains.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>This approach to civil liability will also limit the risk of excessive litigation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The measures related to public enforcement of the due diligence duty do not go beyond what is necessary. This Directive clarifies that any sanction imposed due to non-compliance with the due diligence obligations has to be proportionate. If the public authorities that investigate the company’s compliance with this Directive identify a failure to comply they should first grant the company an appropriate period of time to take remedial action. The Directive outlines a limited number of sanctions that should apply in all Member States but leaves it to the Member States to ensure a proportionate enforcement process, in line with their national law. When pecuniary sanctions are imposed, they shall be based on the company’s turnover to ensure their proportionate level.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Furthermore, this Directive does not entail unnecessary costs for the Union, national governments, regional or local authorities. The Directive will leave it up to the Member States how to organise enforcement. Supervision can be carried out by existing authorities. To reduce the costs (for instance when supervising third-country companies active in various Member States) and improve the supervision, coordination, investigation and exchange of information the Commission will set up a European Network of Supervisory Authorities. </span>

            <p class="Normal">

The Council Conclusions on Human Rights and Decent Work in Global Supply Chains of 1 December 2020 called upon the Commission to table a proposal for an EU legal framework on sustainable corporate governance, including cross-sector corporate due diligence obligations along global value chains.</span>

               <span>The analysis in the impact assessment addressed in a broad sense the problem arising from the need to reinforce sustainability in corporate governance and management systems, with two dimensions: (1) stakeholder interests and stakeholder-related (sustainability) risks to companies are not sufficiently taken into account in corporate risk management systems and decisions; (2) companies do not sufficiently mitigate their adverse human rights and  environmental impacts, do not have adequate governance, management systems and measures to mitigate their harmful impacts. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>After consideration of different policy options mainly in the areas of corporate due diligence duty and directors’ duties, the impact assessment proposed a preferred package of policy options across three elements: corporate due diligence, directors’ duties and remuneration, which complement each other.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>With regard to its importance and urgency, the Commission also took note that the initiative was included in the Joint Political Priorities for 2022 by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>After careful analysis of the Board’s findings and considering the reflections on the additional clarifications and evidence provided, the Commission considers that the proposal, which has been significantly revised as compared to the package of policy options put forward by the impact assessment, allows still to decisively move forward towards the overall objective to better exploit the potential of the single market to contribute to the transition to a sustainable economy and to foster long-term sustainable and responsible corporate behaviour. The Directive is more focused and targeted compared to the preferred option outlined in the draft impact assessment. The core of it is the due diligence obligation, while significantly reducing directors’ duties by linking them closely to the due diligence obligation. In addition, the scope of due diligence is adapted. A detailed description of the adaptations made to the preferred option package of the impact assessment can be found in the accompanying Staff Working Document that presents the follow-up to the opinion of the Regulatory Scrutiny Board and additional information.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In short, the “personal scope” i.e. which business categories are covered has been significantly reduced following reflections triggered by the Board’s comments on the problem description, in particular with regard to SMEs, and on the proportionality of the preferred option. Concretely, SMEs have been completely excluded, from the scope, and the coverage of high-impact sectors has been shifted only to companies having more than 250 employees and more than EUR 40 million worldwide net turnover (while large companies which simultaneously exceed both the 500 employee and the EUR 150 million worldwide net turnover limits are covered by the scope irrespective of their sectors of economic activities. The high-impact sectors are directly defined in the text, thus also reflecting on the Board’s comments as regards legislative technique. The definition of high-impact sectors has been limited to sectors with high risk of adverse impacts and for which OECD guidance exists. For midcap companies in high-impact sectors, the rules will start to apply after a transition period of two years to allow for a longer adaptation period. In addition, the due diligence obligations of these companies are limited only to severe impacts relevant for their sector. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>To reach the objectives of the initiative effectively, the scope of this proposal extends to companies from third countries. Only such non-EU companies are covered which have a direct link to the Union market, and which meet the similar turnover threshold as EU companies but within Union market. Furthermore, they will face the same obligations regarding due diligence as the respective EU companies. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Directive also indicates that accessible and practical support is necessary for companies, in particular SMEs in the value chain, to prepare for the obligations (or the consequent demands the may be passed on to them indirectly). This could include practical guidance and supporting tools such as hotlines, databases or training, as well as the setup of an observatory to help companies with the implementation of the Directive. Moreover, the review clause makes explicit reference to the personal scope of the Directive (i.e. coverage of business categories), which should be reviewed in light of the practical experiences with the application of the legislation. Other mitigation measures to reduce indirect impact on the SMEs are part of the obligations of companies in the scope of this Directive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>As regards the material scope (i.e. what is covered), a cross-cutting instrument covering human rights and environmental impacts has been retained. This reflects the strong consensus amongst stakeholder groups that a horizontal framework is necessary to address the identified problems. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Furthermore, the Board </span><span>commented</span><span> that the impact assessment is not sufficiently clear about the need to regulate directors’ duties on top of due diligence requirements</span><span>.</span><span> The Commission therefore decided to address this issue by deviating</span><span> </span><span>from the preferred options’ package in the impact assessment </span><span>and focussing </span><span>on</span><span> the directors’ duties element</span><span>, i</span><span>n light</span><span> also</span><span> of the existing international standards</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               </span><span>, </span><span>on</span><span> due diligence</span><span> and duty of care</span><span>.
